# Guess The Number Game

In this game you have to guess the number , on each guess to you get to know the count of right number of digits you have guessed and also the right location (if any.)

For Example :
Say, the right number is 2472 and you guessed the number as 1273,
the output will be Right numbers : 2 and right location : 1 because
2 and 7 are the right guess numbers but only 7 is on its right position.

> Note : You will not be able to see the right numbers, only the count of right numbers.

The challenge is to guess the numbers in the minimum possible moves.
